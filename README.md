# Right To Ask UI mock-up - Passing Data

This sample sketches the information flow through some of the important screens of Right To Ask. Emphasis is on  logical flow, not style. We're getting users to test this UI, which will subsequently be incorporated into the real app.

It was derived from Microsoft's [Passing Data](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/Navigation/PassingData) sample.

## Setup Instructions
On Mac or Windows, you'll need something to compile Xamarin: Visual Studio, VS Code, or JetBrains Rider.

On Linux, follow @eleanor-em's [Xamarin-on-Linux setup instructions](XamarinOnLinux.md).
